# Llama Trauma
Llama Trauma is an augmented reality tower defence game for iOS created by programmers Brendon Matusch and Aidan Zerwer, and artists Grace Reich and Ian Langille. It is built with the Unity game engine and uses the ARKit framework for augmented reality.

We originally created the game in 48 hours at the Northern Game Design Challenge (https://www.northerngdc.ca). We have polished and fixed the game since the competition, and are currently working on getting it into the App Store.

Feel free to download this repository, compile it with Unity for iOS, and run it on your iPhone. Enjoy!
